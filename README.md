# ECM1417Coursework

ECM1417 was a web development module where we had to create a website to play the pairs game where you turn over pairs of cards until they all match.

As part of the specification several different sections to the website needed to be implemented. These included a homepage, login page, game page and a leaderboard change.
No database was used due to the specification.
